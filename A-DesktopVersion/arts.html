                    Art is often considered the process or product of 
                    deliberately arranging elements in a way that appeals 
                    to the senses or emotions. It encompasses a diverse 
                    range of human activities, creations and ways of 
                    expression, including music, literature, film, 
                    sculpture and paintings.

                     of therapy, or even as a means to find beauty in life
