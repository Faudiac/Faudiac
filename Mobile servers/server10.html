            The Universe is thought to consist of three types of substance: normal matter,
             'dark matter' and 'dark energy'. Normal matter consists of the atoms that make 
             up stars, planets, human beings and every other visible object in the Universe.

            Astronomy (from the Greek ἀστρονομία from ἄστρον astron, "star" and -νομία -nomia from 
            νόμος nomos, "law" or "culture") means "law of the stars" (or "culture of the stars" 
            depending on the translation).

        </a>

        <p class="Descriptions">
            Astronomy is the study of everything in the universe beyond Earth's atmosphere. 
            That includes objects we can see with our naked eyes, like the Sun , the Moon , the planets, 
            and the stars . It also includes objects we can only see with telescopes or other instruments, 
            like faraway galaxies and tiny particles.

            <button class="LinkHead">When was Astronomy invented?</button>
        </a>

        <p class="Descriptions">
            The first documented records of systematic astronomical observations date back to the Assyro-Babylonians 
            around 1000 BCE. From this cradle of civilisation in Mesopotamia – in the southern part of present-day 
            Iraq – astronomers had built up knowledge of the celestial bodies and recorded their periodic motions.
