        <p class="Descriptions">
            Algebra is the part of mathematics that helps represent problems or situations 
            in the form of mathematical expressions.

        <p class="Descriptions">
            Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi was a 9th-century Muslim mathematician and astronomer. 
            He is known as the “father of algebra”, a word derived from the title of his book, Kitab al-Jabr.

        <p class="Descriptions">
            Algebra (from Arabic ‏الجبر‎ (al-jabr) 'reunion of broken parts, bonesetting') is one of 
            the broad areas of mathematics. Roughly speaking, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the 
            rules for manipulating these symbols in formulas;[3] it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics.
            Elementary algebra deals with the manipulation of variables (commonly represented by Roman letters) as if 
            they were numbers and is therefore essential in all applications of mathematics. Abstract algebra is the 
            name given, mostly in education, to the study of algebraic structures such as groups, rings, and fields 
            (the term is no more in common use outside educational context). Linear algebra, which deals with linear 
            equations and linear mappings, is used for modern presentations of geometry, and has many practical 
            applications (in weather forecasting, for example). There are many areas of mathematics that belong to 
            algebra, some having "algebra" in their name, such as commutative algebra, and some not, such as Galois 
            theory.
