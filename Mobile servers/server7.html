        <p class="Descriptions">
            Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist, 
            widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential 
            physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the 
            theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to 
            the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.

        <p class="Descriptions">
            He Albert Einestine was born in Uim, Germany, March 14 in the year 1879. 
            He sadly passed away in April 18, 1955—Albert Einstein dies soon after a 
            blood vessel bursts near his heart. When asked if he wanted to undergo 
            surgery, Einstein refused, saying, "I want to go when I want to go. It 
            is tasteless to prolong life artificially.

            a 160 IQ
        </p>

        <p class="Descriptions">
            Albert Einstein likely never took an IQ test but is estimated to have a 
            160 IQ—but even that can't stand up to the masterminds.
