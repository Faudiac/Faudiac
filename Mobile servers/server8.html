        <p class="Descriptions">
            Winston grew up with social status, privilege, and a keen sense of heritage, 
            but little money. In the custom of the day, he was raised by a nanny and sent 
            to boarding schools. It was a lonely and hard life for a sensitive and 
            imaginative child.
        </p>

        <p class="Descriptions">
            Blenheim Palace was always one of Churchill's favourite places. He spent much 
            of his time as a child there, both before he went to school and during school 
            holidays.
